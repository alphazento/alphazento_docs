## Contribution Guide

Any contribution to Alphazento is more than welcome!

### Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. To make things easier for contributors and maintainers, we use CMTY.

Please make sure to include a reproduction repository so that bugs can be reproduced without great efforts. The better a bug can be reproduced, the faster we can start fixing it!

### Pull Requests

We'd love to see your pull requests, even if it's just to fix a typo!

However, any significant improvement should be associated to an existing feature request or bug report.
